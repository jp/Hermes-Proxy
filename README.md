# Hermes Proxy

Hermes Proxy is a desktop HTTP/HTTPS interception app built with Electron and Vite.
It captures requests/responses, lets you replay requests, and export/import HAR files.

## Features
- Live traffic table with request/response details
- Replay requests (with editable URL/headers)
- Export all traffic as HAR
- Import HAR files into the traffic table
- Save response bodies
- Rules engine to match method/host/url/headers and either delay requests, override headers, or close connections

## Development
Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## MCP Bridge (stdio)

Hermes includes a local, in-process MCP server. For external agents, use the `hermes-mcp-bridge` CLI, which exposes the same MCP methods over stdio without opening any network ports.

### Run the app

1. Start Hermes: `npm run dev` (or `npm run start` for production build)
2. Keep the app running while using the bridge

### Run the bridge

1. Build the bridge: `npm run bridge:build`
2. Launch it as an MCP stdio server:

```bash
node packages/mcp-bridge/dist/cli.js --info "<path to userData>/mcp-bridge.json"
```

### Agent config example

```json
{
  "name": "Hermes MCP",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "hermes-mcp-bridge",
  "args": ["--info", "<path to userData>/mcp-bridge.json"]
}
```

The `mcp-bridge.json` file is generated by the Electron main process and contains the socket path and auth token. It is stored with restrictive permissions.

Run the app in dev mode (Vite + Electron):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build the renderer:

```bash
npm run build
```

Package binaries (macOS/Windows/Linux targets via electron-builder):

```bash
npm run dist -- --publish never
```
